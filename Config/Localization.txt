raidHoursTip00,Journal Tip,,"This server has some special features related to Land Claims:\n1. Scheduled Claim Defense\n- Build Mode: While claimed Land will always be vulnerable to zombie attacks, it will also be protected by damage from hostile players for most of the day.\n- Raid Mode: For a few hours each day, Land Claim Defense will switch to reasonable levels and pvp raiding will be supported.\n- Scheduling: the currently active Claim Mode is displayed as a persistent buff. Select this buff in your character sheet for more info.\n\n2. Raid Protection\nThis extra layer of protection for your claimed land can be enabled/disabled by interacting with your Land Claim Block. Raid Protection prevents zombie raiding during Build Mode by keeping hostile players out of your claimed land, but does not prevent allies or zombies from approaching it. Even when Enabled, Raid Protection has no effect on hostile players during Raid Mode.\n\n3. Squatting Protection\nThis layer of protection will push hostile players out of your claimed land when they log into the server. Squatting Protection is always enabled and active during both Build and Raid Modes. This ensures players cannot be endlessly stuck in trap bases and cannot squat in bases they may have broken into during Raid Mode."

raidProtectionDesc,buffs,Buff,"Special protection on your claimed land will prevent non-ally players from approaching by warping them away when in range.\n\nTo turn Raid Protection ON or OFF, simply approach your Land Claim and Activate it with the action key. This will also cause a green border to appear around your lcb, but keep in mind your protection extends vertically forever.\n\n- [[00FF80]ON[-]] means you're protected from zombie raiding during the scheduled Build Mode, but your base may be easier to discover as a result.\n\n- [[FF007F]OFF[-]] means you are not protected from zombie raiding even during Build Mode... but you might prefer this if you care more about being hidden than being safe once discovered.\n\nWhat you choose to do is ultimately up to you, but [FF8000]we STRONGLY RECOMMEND enabling Raid Protection[-].\n\n{cvar(raidHoursRaidProtection:[00FF80]Raid Protection is currently turned ON[-];[FF007F]WARNING - Raid Protection is currently turned OFF[-]; )} for this territory.
