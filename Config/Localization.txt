[007FFF]Scheduled Claim Defense[-]\n- [00FF80]Build Mode[-]: While claimed Land will always be vulnerable to zombie attacks, it will also be protected by damage from hostile players for most of the day.\n- [FF007F]Raid Mode[-]: For a few hours each day, Land Claim Defense will switch to reasonable levels and pvp raiding will be supported.\n- [FF8000]Scheduling[-]: the currently active Claim Mode is displayed as a persistent buff. Select this buff in your character sheet for more info.\n\n2. [007FFF]Squatting Protection[-]\nThis layer of protection will push hostile players out of your claimed land when they log into the server. Squatting Protection is always enabled and active during both [00FF80]Build[-] and [FF007F]Raid[-] Modes. This ensures players cannot be endlessly stuck in trap bases and cannot squat in bases they may have broken into during [FF007F]Raid Mode[-]."
