raidProtectionDesc,buffs,Buff,"Special protection on your claimed land will prevent non-ally players from approaching by warping them away when in range.\n\nTo turn Raid Protection ON or OFF, simply approach your Land Claim and Activate it with the action key. This will also cause a green border to appear around your lcb, but keep in mind your protection extends vertically forever.\n\n- [[00FF80]ON[-]] means you're protected from zombie raiding during the scheduled Build hours, but your base may be easier to discover as a result.\n\n- [[FF007F]OFF[-]] means you are not protected from zombie raiding even during Build hours! But you might prefer this if you care more about being hidden than being safe once discovered.\n\nWhat you choose to do is ultimately up to you, but [FF8000]we STRONGLY RECOMMEND enabling Raid Protection[-].\n\n{cvar(raidHoursRaidProtection:[00FF80]Raid Protection is currently turned ON[-];[FF007F]WARNING - Raid Protection is currently turned OFF[-]; )} for this territory. Please note that [FF8000]even if enabled, Raid Protection has no effect when the server is in Raid Mode[-]."
