raidHoursTip00,Journal Tip,,"This server has some special features related to Land Claims:\n\n[007FFF]Scheduled Claim Defense[-]\nThe currently active Claim Mode is displayed as a persistent buff. Select this buff in your character sheet for more info.\n- [00FF80]Build Mode[-]: Claimed Land remains protected from hostile player damage.\n- [FF007F]Raid Mode[-]: Land Claim Defense drops to enable pvp raiding at [FF8000]{cvar(raidHoursDefaultDefenseOnline:0)}x online[-], [FF8000]{cvar(raidHoursDefaultDefenseOffline:0)}x offline[-].\n\n[007FFF]Mob Raid Protection[-]\nWhen the owner and all allies are absent, Land Claims [00FF80]prevent damage[-] from all zombies/animals and despawn them upon striking a block. While during [FF007F]Blood Moon[-], zombies, animals, and players are instead warped away from the land claim if blocks are attacked a zombie or animal.\n\n[007FFF]Squatting/Trap Protection[-]\nPlayers who log into a hostile land claim's range will be automatically warped out of range. This prevents one player from 'jailing' another and also provides base builders with confidence that enclosed goodies will remain safe during [00FF80]Build Mode[-]. This feature is always on, regardless of which Land Claim Mode is active.\n\n[007FFF]Bag Drop Mode[-]\nWithin a hostile land claim, logging out or disconnecting will cause you to drop your backpack. Any time you're in this situation, viewing the ESC menu will display a warning to let you know."
